# Hyperdrive-SDK

[Hyperdrive](https://hyperdrive.delv.tech) is an automated market maker that enables fixed-rate markets to be built on top of arbitrary yield sources.

This repo contains hyperdrivepy and hyperdrive-wasm, which are Rust-powered Python and WASM packages for simulating the Hyperdrive AMM.

## Hyperdrivepy local install

The `hyperdrivepy` can be installed quickly via `pip install hyperdrivepy`.

For a local installation, this repo must include a simulation link to the hyperdrive-rust source code.
From the `hyperdrive-sdk` project root, run:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:delvtech/hyperdrive.git ../hyperdrive
ln -s ../hyperdrive hyperdrive
```

To install the Python package `hyperdrivepy`, which wraps `hyperdrive-rs`, you need to:

- setup a [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) that is running `Python 3.10`
- from inside the environment, run `pip install crates/hyperdrivepy`
- test the installation by running `pip install --upgrade -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest`

[optional] To build the package wheel locally, you can navigate to the package folder and use `setup.py`:

- `cd crates/hyperdrivepy`
- `python setup.py bdist_wheel`
  This will make the distribution ready (e.g. a tar.gz file and a .whl file in the dist directory) for your platform.
  To build for more platforms, we use [cbuildwheel](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in our GitHub CI.

## Build Types

PoolInfo and PoolConfig are passed into many of the functions.
These are built from the Hyperdrive abi json with pypechain.
From the hyperdrive-sdk project root, run:

```shell
pip install --upgrade -r requirements-dev.txt
pypechain --line-length 120 --output-dir crates/hyperdrivepy/python/hyperdrivepy/pypechain_types hyperdrive/out/IERC4626Hyperdrive.sol/
```
